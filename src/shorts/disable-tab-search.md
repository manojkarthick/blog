<!-- Excerpt Start -->

Chrome 89 added a tab search button that allows you to quickly see a vertical list of open tabs and close any them quickly.

I understand that some people might find it useful, but I have no use for it and wanted to remove the button.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

You can follow these steps to remove it:

* Type `chrome://flags` into the address bar of a new tab
* Search for "Enable Tab Search" and click on the dropdown next to it
* Change the value from "Default" to "Disabled" and relaunch the browser.

Hope this helps!
