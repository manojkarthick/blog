<!-- Excerpt Start -->
After a super long hiatus, the blog is back. Since the last time I posted, a lot has changed. I moved to Vancouver, finished my Master's in Computing, and started working as a data engineer. Not to mention we are currently in a global pandemic. 

I consider this to be the second beginning for the blog and aim to post more regularly and hope you'll continue reading the blog.

You might have also noticed that the blog has a new home and a fresh coat of paint. I've migrated the blog from Jekyll to 11ty and moved the hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify. I'll explain why I migrated to 11ty in a future blog post.

I have lots of interesting posts in the pipeline. Stay tuned!

**PS**: The blog now has _DARK MODE_! Be sure to click on the symbol at the top to toggle it on/off!
