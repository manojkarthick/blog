<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Are you a fan of Comic Strips like Garfield, Calvin and Hobbes? Or you're a fan of Web Comics with a dark theme like XKCD or Cyanide and Happiness? You're cool that way huh?
<!-- Excerpt End -->

I never knew about XKCD or C&N earlier. One fine day, my friend introduced them to me. The door to the Wonderful world of Cyanide and Happiness comics was now Ajar! And I have been in love with it ever since.

We had a casual discussion one day whether we could have all the Cyanide and Happiness comics offline, on our systems. And **Eureka!** Comictose was born. We then expanded this idea to include more comic strip series.

Currently, Comictose will download **_Aunty Acid, Big Nate, Calvin and Hobbes, Cyanide and Happiness, Dilbert, Garfield, Peanuts, SMBC, XKCD and ZenPencils_** comics, from the day it was published online till today.

Go ahead and check it out on **[Github](https://manojkarthick.github.io/comictose/)**.

The Scraper is Built using Java and has two dependencies, _JSoup_ and _Joda-time_. Check out the [README](https://github.com/manojkarthick/comictose/blob/master/README.md) to know more.

To run the JARs, just run `java -jar <jar_name>`.

[Pre-built binaries](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2N1I_XfLuyqZndZeGJHay1WSUk) are available for download. Just follow the instructions and run the JAR. You can run the program as long as you have a JRE(Java Runtime Environment), and you most
probably will have it on your system, as Java has become ubiquitious these days!

Cheers!
